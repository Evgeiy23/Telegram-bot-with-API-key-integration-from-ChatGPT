# Telegram-bot-with-API-key-integration-from-ChatGPT

2. Integration with the ChatGPT API-using the API key from OpenAI, the connection to the model takes place, which allows the bot to process requests taking into account the context and enter responses.
3. Easy Setup and Deployment-A setup project so that it can be quickly deployed on a server or locally, make changes and integrate into other systems.
   
Requirement:

1. Python 3.11 or higher
2. Telegram bot API key
